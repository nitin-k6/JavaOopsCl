// Encapulsation is binding or integrating varaiables(data) and methods  in a unit.
// the concept of data hiding comes from the encapsulation. amd data hiding is achieved through access modifiers.

//Data hiding is an object-oriented programming (OOP) technique specifically used to hide internal object details (i.e., data members). Data hiding guarantees exclusive data access to class members only and protects and maintains object integrity by preventing intended or unintended changes and intrusions
//Encapsulation is used to implement data hiding, which protects a class's data and functions from unauthorized access. On the other hand, Encapsulation occurs when data and functions are encased into a single unit. As a result, data hiding helps in achieving encapsulation. 



// Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit, for example, a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.
//  We can create a fully encapsulated class in Java by making all the data members of the class private. Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.

// The Java Bean class is the example of a fully encapsulated class.
